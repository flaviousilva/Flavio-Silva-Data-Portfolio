I obtained this dataset through Kaggle. Here i will post a little description of the dataset, but in case you are interested to check the original, here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores?select=game_lineups.csv  


The dataset is composed of multiple CSV files with information on competitions, games, clubs, players and appearances that is automatically updated once a week. Each file contains the attributes of the entity and the IDs that can be used to join them together.



Clean, structured and automatically updated football data from Transfermarkt, including

-60,000+ games from many seasons on all major competitions

-400+ clubs from those competitions

-30,000+ players from those clubs

-400,000+ player market valuations historical records

-1,200,000+ player appearance records from all games



This dataset is a live project subject to regular updates and new enhancements. The best way to find out about the different initiatives within this project and their status is to check the Issues section on transfermarkt-datasets.
